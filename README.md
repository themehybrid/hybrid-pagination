# Hybrid\\Pagination

Hybrid Pagination is a fork of the core WordPress `paginate_links()` function to give theme authors full control over the output of their pagination. Unfortunately, core doesn't give theme authors much flexibility for altering the markup and classes. This class is meant to solve this issue.  It also standardizes the pagination used for posts, singular (multi-page) posts, and comments.

## Requirements
